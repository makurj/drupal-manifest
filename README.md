# Drupal Sites Manifest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ITS-UofIowa/drupal-manifest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ITS-UofIowa/drupal-manifest)

The Drupal Sites Manifest is a master list of all University of Iowa Drupal websites that are managed by the Nile project on Acquia Cloud.

Sites are added manually during the provisioning process.

## Determining where to place your site in the manifest
Please use the following when determining where to put your site in the file:

1. Sites are listed alphabetically by application (uiowa701 first, then uiowa702, etc)
  a. _This is applicable for the uiowa701 application only:_ uiowa.edu/* sites are listed alphabetically first (beginning with the UI Homepage site).
3.  All other *.uiowa.edu sites are listed alphabetically (regardless of site type).
4.  Then all non-uiowa.edu sites are listed alphabetically.
